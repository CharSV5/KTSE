# KTSE

## Introduction
* MA final project for Game category
* Team of 5: Alfie, Charlene, Chris, Julian, Tom
* Our project focus is to come up with a well-designed game, as opposed to focusing on learning new technology or coming out with a polished marketable product.

## Game Concept
Katsu-to-SpaceEx (KTSE)* is a strategic survival simulation (SSS) game where a player must complete a 12-cycle educational bootcamp course to secure the best job possible. Each cycle, the player has a set number of Action Points (AP) to perform actions which will influence their Energy level (EL) and/or Project Quality (PQ).
* EL must remain above 0 for the player to continue playing and the lower the EL, the higher the AP cost is to perform actions.
* The higher the PQ, the better the job the player secures at the end of the game.
* The player must manage random events and decision-points which will affect them in various ways.
* The player can interact with Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) who may, within limits, offer bonus effects to support the player’s performance.
KTSE has been developed using the following technologies*:

## Architecture Model

## Domain Model

## Project Approach

## Project Kick Off
* Brainstorming (generated 6 ideas)
* Voting - round 1 (down-selected to 3 ideas)
* Define high-level MVP (improve understanding)
* Voting - round 2 (down-selected to 1 idea)
* Define overarching game concept (objective, features, high level mechanics)
* Refine MVP

## Tech Stack
* Primary Language: <del>C#</del> Javascript
* Test Framework: Mocha, Chai, Zombie
* Web Application Framework: Express

We made our decision to go with these technologies via:
* Online research
* Seeking advice from coaches
* Seeking advice from MA alumni
* Seeking advice from expert game developers

## C# vs Javascript
When deciding what technologies we wanted to create our game in, we had an interesting segway at the start of our project to attempt to create our game in C#. Reasons for this included:
- C# is a popular language in the gamedev industry
- Availability of libraries and frameworks such as Unity and XNA/MonoGame
- The challenge of learning another language

However, after a day and a half of setting up our developer environment, we decided to make the move back to JavaScript as the software and utilities available to those using a Mac were immature compared to their Windows counterparts. Visual Studio also has UI differences between the two operating systems, causing further confusion as we attempted to navigate and gain a foothold in making a start on the language.

We did manage to get sprites working and a game building and running successfully using the MonoGame framework - and some of our members are considering revisiting C# post-course on our Windows environments to work on a game as a side project.
