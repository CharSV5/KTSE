**Intro**
You have been accepted into one of the world's most prestigious bootcamps.
You are ambitious, driven and determined to get the best possible job out of it.
However, what job you get is determined by how well you perform on the course!
Will you succeed become the next budding programmer at SpaceEx working alongside the inspirational Elon Musk?
Or will you botch it all and end up working at the Chicken Katsu Wrap market stall with the angry shouty Chinese lady?
Only time will tell...
Welcome to
KTSE Academy!

**Day 1**
Day 1 in the Big Bro-... KTSE Academy

Ned: Welcome! Here at KTSE Academy, we will coach you to teach yourself how to learn to learn... again.
Ned: To facilitate this, you will work on projects to apply your knowledge.
Ned: The better you understand, the better your project quality, the better your job prospects!
Ned: Pick your first project assignment:
1. Santander Cycles (lower project score / AP cost / EL cost)
2. Just Consume
3. Fight Club (higher project score / AP cost / EL cost)

Ned: <selection> - a great choice!
Ned: At KTSE, it is up to you how you spend your time, but every action you take will consume Action Points (AP).
Ned: You are able to make the following actions:
Ned: Project Work - this will improve your Project Quality (PQ) and thus improve your job prospects.
Ned: Get Help - this will provide you with guidance to do better on your Project (PQ multiplier).
Ned: Meditate - this will improve how much you can do (max AP) and your Energy Level (EL).
Ned: You must go to the right location to undertake any of these actions - moving requires AP too!
Ned: You now have the rest of your day to do as you wish. Spend it wisely.
